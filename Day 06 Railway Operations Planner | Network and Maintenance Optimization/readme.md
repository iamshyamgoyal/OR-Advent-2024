# Railway Operations Planner | Network & Maintenance Optimization

The sushi train is leaving the station!

I'm a railway operations planner in La FerrORvia Italiana.

Our railway system in Italy is one of the busiest in Europe, and efficient planning is crucial to maitaining smooth operations.

We face a logistical challenge: optimizing the assignment of maintenance resources to ensure that all critical segments of our railway network are covered.

We want to minimize the costs of such operations.
