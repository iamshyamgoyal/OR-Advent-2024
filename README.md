# OR-Advent-2024  

This repository contains my solutions to the daily Operations Research (OR) problems from the [OR Advent Calendar 2024](https://advent.bmenendez.com/).  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

Each day's problem is organized in a separate folder, named as:  


Each folder contains the following:  

- ðŸ“œ **Problem Statement** â€“ A description of the problem.  
- ðŸ“Š **Data** â€“ Any input files or datasets used for the problem.  
- ðŸ’¡ **Approach** â€“ Explanation of the methodology, algorithms, and optimization techniques applied.  
- ðŸ–¥ **Implementation (Python)** â€“ The solution code written in Python.  
- ðŸ“‘ **Additional Notes** â€“ Insights, challenges faced, and alternative approaches considered.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  

- Strengthen problem-solving skills in Operations Research.  
- Apply various optimization techniques and algorithms.  
- Maintain a consistent streak of solving OR problems daily.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies  

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Optimization Libraries**: PuLP, OR-Tools, Gurobi (if applicable)  
- **Graph & Network Algorithms**: Shortest path, flow networks, scheduling, etc.
